# NodeForge
NodeForge is a 3D simulation and visualization platform for designing node‑based environments. It enables users to construct, inspect, and animate complex scenes such as architectural layouts, marine vessels, or interactive systems. Each node can represent a room, object, or logical unit, and the platform provides tools to manage their structure, relationships, and presentation.

# Features
Interactive 3D canvas with multi‑deck layouts

- Node‑based simulation: rooms, links, groups, and flows

- Real‑time editing tools: wireframes, lighting, shadows, labels, and dimensions

- Scene configuration for snapping, placement, and HUD customization

- Inspector panel for editing node, room, and link properties

- Import/export support and picture management

- Reveal FX modes and demo tour for presentations

# Example Interface
NodeForge includes a layered 3D layout viewer, a left‑side editor panel for managing nodes, decks, and logic, and a right‑side inspector for property editing. Users can toggle wireframes, lighting, shadows, and labels to customize the scene. Selected elements are highlighted for intuitive interaction.
